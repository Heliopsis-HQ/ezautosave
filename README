eZ Autosave enables the automatic and transparent saving of the draft
while editing a content in eZ Publish.

This extension is based on QH Autosave by Quoc-Huy NGUYEN DINH


Features
========

- Regurlarly save the draft (interval defined in
  autosave.ini/[AutosaveSettings]/Interval)
- Save the draft when the user leaves a form field (enable/disable
  through autosave.ini/[AutosaveSettings]/TrackUserInput)
- Hide the "Store draft" button (enable/disable through
  autosave.ini/[AutosaveSettings]/HideStoreDraftButton)
- Try to save the draft if the editor unexpectedly quits the content
  edit page (back button, close browser, ...)

Requirements
============

- eZ Publish 4.7 or +
- ezjscore

TODO
====

- Add timeout support as soon as the YUI3 bug #2531308 is fixed
  http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yui3/ticket/2531308
- When timeout is implemented, add a Retry button in case of timeout
- Use the output of the ezjscore action to update the content edit form:
  for instance, after uploading an image, the preview could be updated
  or the unvalidated field could be hightlighted.
- Let the editor disable/enable the autosave process
- Let the editor choose the interval between two autosave attempts
